## Prerequisits
You need a copy of the game, sadly all versions of Fate/Stay Night are unavailable for purchase and thus constitute abandonware. But I highly recomend following this steps in order to overcome this problem:

  1. Search for these exact terms: [`nyaa "Fate/stay night [Realta Nua] for Windows"`](https://www.google.com/search?q=nyaa+%22Fate%2Fstay+night+%5BRealta+Nua%5D+for+Windows%22&oq=nyaa+%22Fate%2Fstay+night+%5BRealta+Nua%5D+for+Windows%22), it should be the first result.
  
  2. Click where it says "Download Torrent", in the apper part.
  
  3. Once you downloaded the torrent file, you should have these files:
      * `Fate.rar`
      * `Fate Crack.rar`
      * `Heaven's Feel.7z`
      * `Heaven's Feel Crack.rar`
      * `Unlimited Blade Works.rar`
      * `Unlimited Blade Works Crack.rar`
      
## Instalation

There are two methods of installation:
   - Using the instalation script from [Lutris](https://lutris.net/games/fatestay-night/). **(recommended)**
   
   - Downloading and executing the scrip yourself with the `lutris -i fsnue-v1.1.2.yml` command. 

## Patches
After the instalation, you can downlaod some patches, must of the are optional, but there is one that in **required** to even run the game. All the patches can be found in [this mega folder](https://mega.nz/folder/DMsXCIoD#ubkrOC40vxEJDAslcnScow/folder/HAkkjQja). <ins>To install the patches put them in the Ultimate Edition directory, alogside Fate.exe</ins>.

This is the list of all the patches available: 
  * patch.xp3 → You <ins>**ALWAYS**</ins> need this. The game will not work without it.
  * patch_lang_english.xp3 → Adds the option to switch to English text, instead of the original Japanese.
  * patch_hd.xp3 → Adds the option to play at 1.6x resolution (1280x960) instead of the default 800x600.
  * patch_hd_1600.xp3 → Adds the option to play at 2.0x resolution (1600x1200).
  * patch_hd_1920.xp3 → Adds the option to play at 2.4x resolution (1920x1440).
  * patch_h.xp3 → Adds the option to restore the ecchi/hentai content from the 18+ PC release from 2004, including demosaic choices.
  * patch_op.xp3 → Adds the option to access Vita/mobile, PS2, and original 2004 PC opening movies in high resolution.
  * patch_vita_ost.xp3 → Adds the option to use the remixed soundtracks from the Vita/mobile release.
 
## Configuration
I strongly recomend enabeling these:
  * **Patch → Movie content → Skip movies in-game.** This causes an error, you can watch them in the Extras menu option.
  * **Language → English.** Sometimes the game starts in Japanese by default.
