## Prerequisits
You need a copy of the game, sadly all versions of Fate/Stay Night are unavailable for purchase and thus constitute abandonware. But I highly recomend following this steps in order to overcome this problem:

  1. Search for these exact terms: [`nyaa "Fate/stay night [Realta Nua] for Windows"`](https://www.google.com/search?q=nyaa+%22Fate%2Fstay+night+%5BRealta+Nua%5D+for+Windows%22&oq=nyaa+%22Fate%2Fstay+night+%5BRealta+Nua%5D+for+Windows%22)
  
  2. Click where it says "Download Torrent", in the apper part.
  
  3. Once you downloaded the torrent file, you should have these files:
      * `Fate.rar`
      * `Fate Crack.rar`
      * `Heaven's Feel.7z`
      * `Heaven's Feel Crack.rar`
      * `Unlimited Blade Works.rar`
      * `Unlimited Blade Works Crack.rar`
      
## Instalation
 
To begin the instalation, you simply run the `fsnrnue-2022.yml` either with the `lutris -i fsnrnue-2022.yml` or graphicaly using Lutris.
